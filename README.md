# Lake_trout_Lester

This repository contains some information about Lake trout stock assessment models used in DSF Region 3. The Lake Area Mode (LAM) is currently in use (thru 2023) while the Lester model is a candidate to replace the LAM. This repository contains an quarto document Adam Reimer created to help develop some Lester model intuition as well and to make some recommendations to Region 3 staff about how to transition between the two models.

The network location for this repository is S:\RTS\Reimer\Lake_trout_Lester.

Folders/Files in this repository are:

-   documentation: a variety of background information including pdfs describing both models and Region 3 staff's thoughts about both models. (gitignored but available on the S drive)

-   function\lester_model_R_code.r: A function which required the Lake area, mean depth, Max depth and average annual air temperature and provides the Lester model estimates.

-   markdown: a folder with a quarto document and resulting .html file.
